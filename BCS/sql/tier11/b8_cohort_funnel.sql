-- Tier 11 | The 202501 cohort funnel: January calls, per bridge class
-- The within-January funnel for the DQ1 cohort (bridge classes a, b, c from
-- b7; class d dropped - the story is the DQ1 cohort, not all delinquents).
-- Stages copy f1's idioms exactly: episode = first inbound leg per account
-- per day (business-card excluded), transcript presence, customer payment /
-- plan language (f1's loose lexicon, stage g), the clean-payment-within-30-
-- days capture gate (autopay- and NSF-dated payments do not count), and
-- charge-off within 8 months via a forward scan of chrgoff_dt (Jan
-- snapshots cannot carry future charge-off dates). Grain per class label:
-- class a is month-MAX only (cured by EOM, invisible to ASP month-end).
