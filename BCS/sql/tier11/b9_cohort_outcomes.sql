-- Tier 11 | Cohort outcomes: charge-off by bridge class x January caller status
-- Account-level outcomes for the DQ1 cohort (bridge classes a, b, c; class d
-- dropped). Caller status: non-caller / caller captured (at least one January
-- episode with a clean payment within 30 days, f1's gate) / caller leaked.
-- Charge-off windows mirror Ishant's (END_8M=202508, END_10M=202510,
-- END_12M=202512), read from a forward chrgoff_dt scan. His comparables on
-- his 186,412 stock: CO_8M 38,087 (20.4%) / CO_10M 45,524 (24.4%) / CO_12M
-- 51,326 (27.5%); our stock analogue is class b + c on the EOM side,
-- unfiltered, so again compare shares. Caller splits are association, not
-- causation - callers self-select.
