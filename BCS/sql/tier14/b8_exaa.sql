-- Tier 14 | EX-AA VARIANT of b8_cohort_funnel.
-- Exclusion: clnt_prdct_cd at the account's January EOM snapshot (eom_cpc,
-- max_by(clnt_prdct_cd, eff_dt) over the January row), matched against the
-- SAS AA+GM+Bronco code set (23 codes). Applied on the account population
-- CTE (classed), so cohort classes a/b/c (class d still dropped, unchanged)
-- are all ex-AA. NULL-safe form: NULL or blank cpc is kept as "others".
-- Expected tie-out: run AFTER b14_exaa and b7_exaa tie out. b8_exaa's stage-1
-- ("cohort accounts") totals across classes a+b+c should sum to 189,146
-- MINUS class-d-equivalent removal already applied upstream by b7 - i.e. the
-- b8_exaa cohort total is a NEW ex-AA measurement to check for internal
-- consistency (stage counts monotonically non-increasing down the funnel),
-- not an exact tie to 189,146 (b8's cohort excludes class d, b14's ledger
-- does not carry class d at all - different populations by construction,
-- as in the original kit).
-- Everything else is unchanged from b8_cohort_funnel.sql: the bucket ladder,
-- bridge-class definitions, cohort filter (NOT LIKE 'd.%'), payment gate,
-- transcript scan, and stage funnel.
